Our mission is to accelerate the accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological science, reducing the distance between truth about human behavior and mental processes and our current understanding. This challenge cannot be adequately met by a single researcher or small team. Instead, we attempt to meet this challenge with a distributed laboratory network that is ongoing (as opposed to time or task limited), diverse (both in terms of human subjects and participating researchers), and inclusive (we welcome ideas, contributions, study proposals, or other input from anyone in the field of psychology).

Project	dreinstein@rethinkpriorities.org	daaronr@gmail.com			The "Unjournal" (with funding from the Long Term Future Fund via ACX grants) will not 'publish any journal'; we will organize and fund public journal-independent feedback, rating, and evaluation of  hosted papers and dynamically-presented research projects. We will focus on work that is highly relevant to global priorities (especially in economics, social science, and impact evaluation). We will encourage better research by making it easier for researchers to get feedback and credible ratings on their work.  Why? Peer review is great, but academic publication processes are wasteful, slow, and rent-extracting. They discourage innovation and encourage a great deal of effort spent 'gaming the system'. We will both provide an immediate alternative and also offer a bridge to a better system.  We will do this through: Identifying relevant research work, to be hosted on any open platform in any format that can gain a time-stamped DOI.  Authors can present their work in the ways they find most convenient, complete, and legible. We will encourage and enable dynamic documents and other formats that promote replicability and open science. Paying reviewers to evaluate and give careful feedback on this work. We will elicit quantifiable and comparable metrics of research quality as credible measures of value.     Reviews may be made public (perhaps only by authors' permission, this is a point to discuss), along with authors' possible replies. This will facilitate dialogue and a greater understanding of research.  We will link work but not 'publish it'.  This process will not be 'exclusive': authors can 'submit their work to a journal' at any point. This will also serve to benchmark our evaluations.   We will consider funding later rounds of review/evaluations of improved and expanded versions of previously-evaluated work. Awarding financial prizes (perhaps combined with public presentations) for the work judged to be the strongest We will aim to be as transparent as possible in our processes and judgments.
